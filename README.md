# Popi Mundial

Popi Mundial was one of the first fullstack apps that I built. I wanted to combine my passion of music, with my current spanish language integration by creating a blog to keep track of spanish language songs that I find and like.

Using Typescript, Tailwind, Express, and React powered by Vite i was able to construct a fully responsive website connected to a backend that used MongoDb for data storage and queries.

I still update this site with music so feel free to browse through and catch some vibes. üèù
